# vbscript-to-typescript

This is a very simple tool that uses a bunch of regular expressions to perform some simple syntax changes from VBScript to TypeScript. Since it only convers very simple cases, manual optimizing will be needed to get the result running.

However, it will make your life much easier if you want to convert a legacy ASP application that was written in VBScript (which was the reason for me to write this tool).

## Usage
```
convertvbs [filename]
```

## Warning
I created this tool very specific for the needs of my project; it might not be of much use for general usage. But I think it can give some ideas how to handle old VBScript code.
